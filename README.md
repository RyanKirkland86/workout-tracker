# Workout Tracker

## Project:

This is a NoSQL project using MongoDB and Mongoose that allows for a user to view, create, and track daily workouts. The user may log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day and are able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, they are able to track the distance traveled.
